- Roll the dice
- Add the sum to the list
- Print the list
- Main

Purpose: Get a value for the roll of the dice  
Name: roll_dice  
Parameters: None  
Return: Sum of the two dice rolls  
Algorithm:
1. Get a random number from one to six and store it within a variable such as 'roll1'
2. Get another random number from one to six and store it within a variable such as 'roll2'
3. Add roll1 and roll2 and store it within a variable such as 'sum'


Purpose: Make sure the number the user inputs is an integer  
Name: amount  
Parameters: None  
Return: Number user inputs as an integer  
Algorithm:
1. Prompt the user to input the number of dice rolls they want
2. While roll amount is not a digit
   1. Output that the input was invalid and prompt the user to input a digit
3. Convert the number of rolls to an integer


Purpose: Store the amount of times the sum is rolled  
Name: add_to_list  
Parameters: Sum  
Return:   
Algorithm:
1.
