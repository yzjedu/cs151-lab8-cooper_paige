The main purpose of this lab was to give us practice with lists, functions, loops, and random numbers. We took certain 
processes that needed to be done for the problem and turned them into functions to make the code more readable. The main 
problem I faced was figuring out how to put my ideas into the algorithm and into the code successfully. Eventually, with 
my partner's help, we were able to successfully write out the ideas we had. While checking the code, we encountered an 
error that we struggled with for more than five minutes only to realize that it was the result of forgetting a single 
line of code, so we had some fun with that realization. Overall, working with my partner was a great experience, with a 
lot of humor involved, and she was very patient when I worried too much about how to write the algorithm. It was a good 
experience.
